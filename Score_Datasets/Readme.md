For Score_DataSets

This directory holds the scores for each specific sport that will be used for implementation into the heatmap. For each sport, the relevant weather datasets were imported and scored according to optimal conditions. The scaled scores were then added up to give a final score that would be the weight of that time in the heatmap.
